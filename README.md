# PACICO-Prototype

Read this before you go check the website.

Praise be Jesus Christ, now and forever!

Now, as you can see, our website right here is still in progress, and many features will still be added to it to this day. The reason for it is that we have tried so hard to find reliable codes on how to code the main part of it, which is the chatbot. Nevertheless, we still present to you a preview of our upcoming website, which will be released either in January or February.  We would also add new animations and some interactive integrations so that not only is the chatbot informative, but it can also be casual sometimes. For now, our features that have been added to this day are the admission processes, such as enrollments and fees, to exactly understand what the AI is trying to inform. Also, the response of the chatbot comes from our knowledge base, which will be displayed so that you can see some facts that we have written in docx form.

Again, we're sorry for some inconviences encountered while making this.

Thank you, and in all things, God may be glorified.
